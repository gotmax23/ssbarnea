### Credits

I would like to thanks everyone that has aver supported me in my volutary work of supporting open-source project. I should mention at least few of these:

* [Red Hat (IBM)](https://redhat.com), which is also my employer, for giving me the freedom to contribute to whatever open-source project I do see fit and spend a signifiant portion of my work time doing this, not only my free time.
* Every other open-source maintainer which ever reviewed my contributions, or just replied to issues I raise. I do value your help!
* Those that decided to show appeciation by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/ssbarnea). Keep in mind that I donate 100% of what I receive to upstream opensource projects that I use.
* Several companies that found a way to support my work:
  * [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) for providing me with a free license of the great PyCharm
  * [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com) for giving me a license of their powerful dataabase database development tool
  * [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) for providing a free cloud instance of Jira that is used to perform integrations testing on jira python library.

### 2020-12 Updates

2020 proved to be a very stressful year which got me very close to a burnout. One measure that I had to take was to suspend my maintenance of jira library. I am aware that it is affected by a lot of bitrot and nobody was willing to spend the considerable amount of time needed to restore the CI.

Please do not get offeended if I do not reply to support questions on irc or email. Unless I already know you as someone that contributed to one of projects I maintain or just use, I would likely ignore direct messages.
